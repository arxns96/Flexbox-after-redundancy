# Flexbox-after-redundancy

The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills after 3 years of being out of web development. I worked as a junior front end web developer, but due to covid I was made redundant. 

After being made redundant, I was too focused on UX/UI Design as I wanted to up-skill my skill set in UI Design. In 2023 I had a job interview and the interviewer asked me about my skills in Web Dev and to be completely honest, I had forgotten my skills and knowledge of flexbox and media queries. 

This project is to showcase my skills in flexbox and media queries as I wanted to keep my skills fresh. 

I will be creating more projects soon.

Thank you for looking at my work.
